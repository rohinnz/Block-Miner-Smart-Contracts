# Block Miner Game Smart Contracts

Hardhat project containing smart contracts and tests for Block Miner game.

Before deployment to mainnet, a security audit will be done. There may also be a bug bounty.

### Game Client

The game client is being built in Unity using the [ChainSafe web3.unity SDK](https://gaming.chainsafe.io/).

The current prorotype is able to interact with the smart contracts on the Goerli testnet. A WebGL Protototype will be made available soon.
